# UTRPG
### Team 12, Unity Simple Role Playing Game
### Team Members: Jacob Mclemore, Dylan Rainwater, Parker Holt, Jinxiao Yu


**Introduction**

So far, our team has managed to implement a three dimensional map generation engine. We have also implemented movement that works intelligently within these maps, utilizing path finding algorithms. Originally our goal was to create a simple role playing game, but we have recently decided to pivot toward a bullet shooter game. This is because of the time constraints.

**Customer Value**

Because our goal for the game has changed, so has the value to potential customers. Since they are both video games, overall they serve a very similar goal: to entertain. However, this video game will sever a different niche. Instead of appealing to western SRPG gamers, we will appeal to the general audience who enjoys a game that involves instant gratification with little investment. 

**Technology**

The systems will change in our pivot, but, surprisingly, not by much. The movement systems that is already in place can still be utilized, if we decide that a point-and-click movement system works best. Otherwise, we could simplify it to just move on key press events. The combat system will be greatly simplified. Rather than being a turn-based system, it will simply be a live action ensemble of collusion detections. The dialogue system and character statistics system are no longer necessary, so they will be scrapped. 

*TODO: goals for this iteration*

Below are some screenshots of the output of our functioning map generation engine.

*TODO: tests ran?*

Our goals for the next iteration are rational, yet ambitious. We will be overhauling most of our game in order to work differently, utilizing what we can and scrapping what we cannot. Our goal is, as previously stated, to pivot in the direction of a shooter game instead of an RPG game. The reason for this is to reduce the scope of the game overall and be able to have a nontrivial release out by the deadline. 

**Team**

Jinxiao has played a major role in mentoring the overall structure of the video game, since his previous research work has involved a lot of Unity development. He has helped the rest of us get up to speed with the technologies we are using, so far. The rest of us have been developing the functionality of the video game so far.

Moving forward, the roles will change. Instead of having a more management/mentor-like role, Jinxiao will have a more hands on role to our project by implementing some of the future features and aiding in the restructure of the systems in our project. Dylan will help to implement some of the new features and also take a more PR-esque role where he will help with the public image of the game (i.e. presentation). Jacob and Parker will continue developing the internals of the game functionality.

**Project Management**

This has been mostly covered so far, but the product is of course not on schedule. The most recent event has been the decision to pivot to another video game and utilize as much of the work completed as possible while minimizing scope. We have rescheduled the necessary steps and will be working diligently to meet our future goals, now that we have a better idea of how much effort things take within the Unity environment, we are better suited to re-scope and continue working.

**Reflection**

*TODO: what went well?*

The original development schedule didnâ€™t go well. We ended up making a lot less progress in our attempt to learn a lot of new technologies at once while developing a very ambitious project.

In the next iteration, we will be tackling a less ambitious project with a lower scope. This way we can produce a tangible product by the deadline.
